# Crystal
Crystal executor is my attempt at making an executor for executing/injecting Roblox scripts. It's not very big right now, but I intend to make it free.

Crystal executor has been finished in its first and early version. You may install it now or watch a tutorial video.
The tutorial video is work in progress sorry guys, but just extract the zip to Desktop and run the Crystal application inside of the folder.
Check example.png for a sneak peek.

Credits to my good friend Adam for help with making the icon.
